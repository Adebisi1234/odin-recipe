    <p>
        If you live outside Nigeria, <br> you already know about the challenges of preparing Nigerian meals thousands of miles away from Nigeria. <br> Even when one can buy some of the ingredients, <br> the leafy vegetables are usually the impossible ones to find in far away countries. <br> On this page, I'll prepare Efo Riro with alternative vegetables instead of Soko (pronounced shoko) that is normally used for this soup.
        <br>
        <br>
        But whether you are in search of Efo Riro alternatives <br> or you are just looking for a delicious new Nigerian Soup to add to your family menu, <br> this Efo Riro prepared with alternative ingredients is for you.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pick the vegetable from the stalk and slice into chunks <br> <br>
            Rinse vegetable clean, drain and set aside
            <br> <br>
            Wash locust beans and set aside
            <br><br>
            Chop 1 onion and set aside
            <br> <br>
            Shred the smoked fish into flakes and also set aside
            <br><br>
            
            Blend the peppers with the remaining onions <br> with little water coarsely and set aside <br> (I sieved the blended pepper as I choose not to boil the pepper)
        </li> <br>
        <br><br>
        <li>
            Place a pan on  medium heat and add palm oil, <br> heat for about 5 minutes but don't bleach
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Add locust beans and chopped onions and fry for about 2 minutes <br> (In this case, I used half of the locust beans and saved the rest <br> before I finished cooking the soup)
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Add the blended pepper to the palm oil and stir to combine, <br> after about 3 minutes, add the remaining locust beans. <br> Add the diced ponmo and ground crayfish and cook for another 3-4 minutes on low heat <br>
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Add seasoning (bouillon cube/stock) and pinch of salt. <br> (check for salt at the later stage of the cooking)
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Whilst you are waiting for the sauce to cook, <br> boil water enough to cover the vegetable. Once the water is boiled, <br> pour over the vegetable and cover with a lid for 5 minutes. <br> Strain and squeeze out excess water from the vegetable.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Continue to cook the sauce till oil floats on the top, <br> add half of the smoked fish and stir to combine. <br> (You can add little water to the sauce if it is too dry but do not over do it <br> as efo riro is almost water free)
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Add the vegetable to the sauce and stir till all is well incorporated.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Add the remaining smoked mackerel and carefully combine in the vegetable. <br> Check for salt and cook for another 4 minutes. 
            <br>
            Take it off the heat and set aside. <br> Serve with a swallow of choice or rice and you can even choose to eat it on its own.
        </li> <br>
    </ol>
