    <strong>
        VERY IMPORTANT:
    Nigerian Fried Rice can go bad very quickly. <br> You can avoid this by spreading it to cool it then refrigerate immediately. <br> Otherwise, eat it once you finish preparing it. If you want to serve it at a party, please cook it very close to the serving time, <br> if not, it will go bad! If refrigerated, it can last for 48 hours without loosing its taste.

    <h3>Direction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Parboil the rice. <br>
            A well parboiled rice <br> ensures that the grains of the rice will not stick together when the rice is done. <br> Rinse the parboiled rice with cold water <br> and put in a sieve so all the water drains out.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour the chicken stock into a sieve to remove all traces of onions, <br> thyme etc used in cooking the chicken. Pour the stock into a pot and set to boil. <br> Once the water boils, add the parboiled rice. Also, add 1 tablespoon of plain yellow curry powder, then add salt to taste. <br> The plain yellow curry powder is merely for colouring so should not contain chilli.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The water level should be slightly less than the level of the rice; <br> at most it should be at the same level as the rice. <br> This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked and that the rice is not over cooked. <br> This is the quantity of water that will cook the rice and the grains will not stick together. Stir the contents; <br> cover the pot and leave to cook on medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Once the water has dried up, <br> the rice should be cooked perfectly. <br> Perfect fried rice is one that the grains are separated from one another, <br> resistant to the bite but not hard.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, transfer the rice to a casserole dish <br> or another pot to help cool it down quickly. Again, <br> this is essential to keep the grains from sticking to each other. If left in the original hot pot, the rice will continue to cook and eventually stick together. <br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            pour a small amount of vegetable oil into a frying pan. <br> This quantity of oil should be such that it would be absorbed by 1 part of the cooked rice and 1 part each of the vegetables. <br> When the oil is hot, add 1 part of diced onions and stir for 10 seconds, followed by 1 part of diced cow liver, <br> one part each of the diced vegetables, then 1 part of cooked rice.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add more salt if necessary. <br> More curry powder may also be added at this stage <br> if you need to touch up on the color. <br> Stir till all the ingredients have mixed well and transfer to a dry pot. <br> Repeat this for the remaining batches of the ingredients
        </li>
    </ol>
