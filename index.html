    <h3>All About Nigerian Food</h3>
    <p>
        Nigerian food is essential to Nigerian culture. It defines the Nigerian people. <br> This is why wherever we find ourselves; <br> we are ready to eat our food daily without being bored one bit.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We prefer to eat Nigerian food in any country we find ourselves in. <br> This is because we never feel fulfilled if we do not eat correct Naija food from homeland. <br> The so called Oyibo food is not satisfying for an average Naija person!</p>
        <br>
        <p>In Nigeria, eating out is becoming more common these days but usually people eat at home. <br> This is why it is essential that we all know how to cook these meals, especially the female folk. <br> And with Nigerian men increasingly getting closer to the kitchen, cooking Nigerian food is now for all.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Read through the recipes. Learn the ones you do not know. <br> Add to what you know when you see a familiar recipe. <br> With Nigerian food, there are many ways to skin a cat. You never know, you can pick up a tip or two.
